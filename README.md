## My git workflow

In this project I try to use:

- Good commit messages
- Well named branches
- Pull requests with summaries

If you have feedback to improve my git usage: **[please drop me a line!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shashank-neelagiri/)** 

Here is my branching model for this project.

```
master (auto deploys) ___________________
                         \           /
feature/some-feature      \_commits_/- pull request
```

## My agile workflow and Trello board

I try to maintain a backlog eventhough I'm working on a project by myself. That way people can quickly jump in and start helping out. It also displays how I split up my tasks and try to build this project in an iterative and incremental way!
